# Card_Game
I have not writen any code outside of work. I miss having fun with it. So I am creating a project for myself.
I am going to try to follow best practices, but I'm not gonna beat myself up over it.

## Project description
A program that allows a user to play various card games against a computer. Might add a GUI and online multiplayer, but only after the actual game is created.

Card games planned to be included so far:
* War
* Poker
  * Five Card Draw
  * Texas Hold 'em
  * etc
* Blackjack

Probaly some others too but those are the initial plans.

Project will be programmed in Java because I miss using the language. I spent almost half of college as an assistant teacher for a class taught in the language, and haven't touched it since. Despite the sometimes cumbersom nature it is my favorite programming language. Maybe followed by Haskell, but i took that for a semester and almost immediatly forgot it. Still find functional programming sick. I need to get back into that as well.

I think thats all I have to say at the moment.

Thank you,

Henry Bulluck
